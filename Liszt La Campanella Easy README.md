Liszt is a pianist well known for his virtuosity and extremely difficult piano exercises (known as _etudes_). 

_La Campanella_, meaning the sound of bells, begins with the famous repeating notes, as if canterbury bells dangling with lovely sounds in the wind.

Try catching that with the use of pedal! I hope you will find fun in attempting this lovely easy arrangement of the piece while captivating still the tingling sensation.
